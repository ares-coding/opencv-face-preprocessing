# opencv-face-preprocessing

Beginner-friendly guide to face image preprocessing using Python and OpenCV,
designed for Machine Learning and Computer Vision projects.

## What This Repo Covers
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Grayscale conversion
- Image resizing
- Normalization
- Clean dataset organization

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Why This Matters
Proper preprocessing improves:
- Model accuracy
- Training stability
- Generalization performance

This guide is suitable for:
- Beginners learning Computer Vision
- Students working on ML projects
- Thesis and capstone preparation

## Coming Soon
- `preprocess.py` implementation
- Sample dataset structure
- Step-by-step preprocessing walkthrough

Place raw face images inside:

dataset/raw_images/


Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py


Processed images will be saved to:

dataset/processed_images/
