# opencv-face-preprocessing

Beginner-friendly guide to face image preprocessing using Python and OpenCV,
designed for Machine Learning and Computer Vision projects.

## What This Repo Covers
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Grayscale conversion
- Image resizing
- Normalization
- Clean dataset organization

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Place raw face images inside:

dataset/raw_images/
Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py
Processed images will be saved to:
dataset/processed_images/

## Why This Matters

Proper preprocessing improves:
- Model accuracy
- Training stability
- Generalization performance

This guide is suitable for:
- Beginners learning Computer Vision
- Students working on ML projects
- Thesis and capstone preparation

## Coming Soon
- preprocess.py improvements
- Sample dataset structure
- Step-by-step preprocessing walkthrough
